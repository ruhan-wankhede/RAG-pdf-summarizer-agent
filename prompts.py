        Given the user's question, generate a brief, precise search query that includes the main keywords and

        Guidelines:
        - Do NOT include filler words, polite phrases, or irrelevant information
        - Use noun phrases and key concepts only
        - Avoid questions or complete sentences
        - Keep it under 12 words if possible
